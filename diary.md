the function convertPointToDistance requires 'height' to be a power of 2. Looking into ways to rewrite that, or determine if a rewrite is necessary.

parity: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_%28mathematics%29 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit
parity: the number of bits in a byte which are set to 1

Want to express axis rotations internally without creating a point object.
or perhaps use one internally but return an array.

move Point to own module for reuse in Voronoi diagram calculator and r-tree

figure out how to keep track of rotations so we can unrotate.

interesting hilbert implementation. https://github.com/ryan-williams/hilbert-js
I am uncertain of this implementation of the hilbert curve. It iterates
between 2 different hilbert curves as the dimensions increase.
At n = 2 the curve's exit gate is 0,1,0. I would expect to be 1,0,0.
At n = 4 the curve's exit gate is 0,0,3. I would expect to be 3,0,0.
At n = 8 the curve's exit gate is 7,0,0, as is expected.
At n = 16 the curve's exit gate is 0,15,0. I would expect to be 15,0,0.


2D encoding algorithm:
Outline of the Method

To encode from index to coordinates:
"Unpack" the index into a list of h D-bit ints (called "index chunks").
h will be the number of levels of recursion (in our case the number of times to loop); from this calculate the orientation of the overall cube.
Then, for each index chunk, starting at the most- significant,
Use a modified Gray code to convert the index chunk into a D-bit "coordinate chunk" with one bit destined for each of the D coordinates;
Calculate the start and end corners for the child cube to which the indexed point belongs;
Loop to do the child cube.
Finally,
"Pack" the output coordinates by redistributing the D bits from each of h coordinate chunks into D ints, each with h bits.
Decoding is very similar, except that at each stage we Gray- decode D index bits from coordinate bits. At that point the decoder has the same information the encoder uses to calculate the orientation of the child cube for the next stage.

derived key = sequence number of a point.

3D curves: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.2323v1.pdf

binary decomposition: when the scanning order can be defined by `d` rules R0, ..., Rdâˆ’1, where each rule Ri divides a region
    by an axis-parallel cutting plane into two regions of equal size, to each of which ruleR(i+1) mod `d` is applied.
    requires mono curve.

According to the state diagram there are 12 states. Each state is rotation of
state 0.
