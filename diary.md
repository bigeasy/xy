interesting hilbert implementation. https://github.com/ryan-williams/hilbert-js
I am uncertain of this implementation of the hilbert curve. It iterates
between 2 different hilbert curves as the dimensions increase.
At n = 2 the curve's exit gate is 0,1,0. I would expect to be 1,0,0.
At n = 4 the curve's exit gate is 0,0,3. I would expect to be 3,0,0.
At n = 8 the curve's exit gate is 7,0,0, as is expected.
At n = 16 the curve's exit gate is 0,15,0. I would expect to be 15,0,0.


2D encoding algorithm:
Outline of the Method

To encode from index to coordinates:
"Unpack" the index into a list of h D-bit ints (called "index chunks").
h will be the number of levels of recursion (in our case the number of times to loop); from this calculate the orientation of the overall cube.
Then, for each index chunk, starting at the most- significant,
Use a modified Gray code to convert the index chunk into a D-bit "coordinate chunk" with one bit destined for each of the D coordinates;
Calculate the start and end corners for the child cube to which the indexed point belongs;
Loop to do the child cube.
Finally,
"Pack" the output coordinates by redistributing the D bits from each of h coordinate chunks into D ints, each with h bits.
Decoding is very similar, except that at each stage we Gray- decode D index bits from coordinate bits. At that point the decoder has the same information the encoder uses to calculate the orientation of the child cube for the next stage.

derived key = sequence number of a point.

binary decomposition: when the scanning order can be defined by `d` rules R0, ..., Rdâˆ’1, where each rule Ri divides a region
    by an axis-parallel cutting plane into two regions of equal size, to each of which ruleR(i+1) mod `d` is applied.
    requires mono curve.

According to the state diagram there are 12 states. Each state is rotation of
state 0.

Added an order function function for the inverse. It takes the cubed root of the
index, but unfortunately it doesn't work with some of the higher order curves.

Am using this table to decide on m:
```
dim         index       xyz axis    m       bits
1            0-7        0<=x<2      2       3
2           0-63        2<=x<4      3       6
3           0-511       4<=x<8      4       9
4           4095        8<=x<16     5       12
5           32767       16<=x<32    6       15
6         262,144       32<=x<64    7       18
7       2,097,151       64<=x<128   8       21
8       16,777,215      128<=x<256  9       24
